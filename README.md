📘 Employee Performance Review System

A simple full-stack web application that allows employees to submit feedback toward each other’s performance reviews.
This project was built as part of a technical assessment.
The goal was to demonstrate understanding of:

✔ REST API design
✔ Java Spring Boot (CRUD, DTOs, Services, Repositories)
✔ React frontend
✔ Entity relationships in JPA
✔ CORS handling
✔ Basic UI for admin and employee operations

The application is intentionally small and focuses on clean architecture and working functionality rather than UI complexity.
